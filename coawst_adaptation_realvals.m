% I have to double check but I recall nuGp has units [1/day] 
%AMC then has units kg/[s m^2 ]  (e.g. the total growth for 180 days, is resealed to a yearly rate in seconds)
%then (kg/[s m^2]) /( kg/[m^3]) = m/s  which is the vertical accretion rate as appropriate
%As for the scaling factor, this was a simple math excercise.
%It will take me time to recreate but basically, when the 
%derivative of the parabola is zero you want the function to evaluate at 
%1 given the two roots Dmax and Dmin of the parabola
